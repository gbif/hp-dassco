text: DTU is the technical engine behind some of DaSSCo’s digitisation methods. The university develops and refines imaging systems, 3D scanning techniques, and automated processing workflows that make high-volume digitisation possible. DTU’s work helps ensure that specimens are captured efficiently and consistently, so data can flow into the shared DaSSCo systems for eveyone to benefit from.

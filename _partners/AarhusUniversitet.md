text: Science Museums Aarhus University contributes key scientific collections to the DaSSCo programme, including major botanical holdings in its herbarium. The institution supports the practical side of DaSSCo’s digitisation work by preparing and digitising collection data, so it can be integrated into the shared DaSSCo systems and infrastructure.

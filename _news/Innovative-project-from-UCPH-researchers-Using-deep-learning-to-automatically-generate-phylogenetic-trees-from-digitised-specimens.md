14.000 beetles. 1 deep learning algorithm.

Beetles, the largest group of organisms on Earth, are now front figure in a collections-based research at Natural History Museum of Denmark. Researchers behind the project are using digital images of specimens from the museum’s collection and a deep learning algorithm to generate phylogenetic trees.
